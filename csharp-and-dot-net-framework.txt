C# is a language, .NET is an application framework.
The .NET libraries can run on the CLR and thus any language which can run on the CLR can also use the .NET libraries.
In .NET you don't find only C#. You can find Visual Basic for example. If a job requires .
NET knowledge, probably it need a programmer who knows the entire set of languages provided by the .NET framework.
